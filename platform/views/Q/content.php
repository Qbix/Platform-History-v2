<div id="content">
	<h1>Content</h1>
	<h2>Please override the "Q/response/content" handler.</h2>
	<p>
		This is what was rendered inside the "content" slot.
		Q apps typically generate a response by filling a bunch of
		standard slots and then presenting them in a layout.
		The default ones are "content", "dashboard", "title" and "errors".
		Of course, you are free to have a completely different set of slots
		for your webpages, but to be consistent, you are encouraged to stick
		to these.
