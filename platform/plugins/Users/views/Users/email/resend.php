<h2>
	This is an example email for resetting your passphrase, generated by views/Users/email/resend.php
</h2>

<p>
	You should make own view for resend emails, and then set the
	"Users"/"transactional"/"activation"/"subject" and
	"Users"/"transactional"/"activation"/"body" config fields.
</p>

<p>
	We should remember to put a link so you can reset your password,
	<?php echo Q_Html::a($link, 'like this') ?>
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 100px;">
	And somewhere on the bottom, you'll probably want to place a link to:
	<?php echo Q_Html::a($unsubscribe, 'unsubscribe') ?>
</p>
